Felgen [[my most loyal follower]]

This project is very unusual and thusly the writeup starts with the conclusion. 
Rather than posting project takeaways for this one, I would like to justify what must appear to be an exceptionally awful lack of planning.

The Project Goal is the starting point of every project. You decide what it should do, what it can't do, then design to accomodate those needs.
Felgen has always been and likely always will be a "Personal Growth" project. It lacks any Project Goal whatsoever and its revisions are usually the result of whimsy to the tune of, "I would really like to learn how to use [Blender/C#/Altium/Magnetometers/etc.]; I can do that by tinkering with Felgen."

Now we go back to the beginning.

Felgen was born in 2012 to the joyous parents Asinine College Project and Feature Creep.

Obligatory ugly baby photos follow:

The benal task I was asked to perform was to automate a remote controlled vehice (a NewBright Baja Buggy) to allow for acceleration, a single turn, then more acceleration.

Provided at no cost to me was a microcontroller which could be programmed only in BASIC and an unspoiled (clearance) RC Car. Programming such a turn of events took only moments. Bypassing the Radio Receiver (which was integrated as part of the motor controller) took equally a brief period of time. A 3 month project was accomplished in under an hour. Idle hands make projects baloon in terms of cost, both time and USD. 

I would have preferred to change the microcontroller, both to accomodate a language other than BASIC and to allow for the top cover to be used. Additionally the steering mechanism was developed for affordability not control, so a "fine, accurate turn" was impossible. Rather than changing the microcontroller and changing the steering mechanism as separate steps, I elected to fix two birds with one stone, as it were. 

Over the summer I taught myself Solidworks and modeled a new chassis (to better fit the current microcontroller) and steering mechanism (to utilize a servo rather than a motor.)

I then had these 3d printed, tested them to my satisfaction, and began the next iteration with a (stupidly) more robust microcontroller.

A number of things happened around the same time and, as is the problem with making documentation well after the fact, I can't recall portions of the build process accurately.

The circumstances can be simplified to: 
A) I had a small working robot. 
B) I had been recruited to be a member of the college Robotics Team.
C) The college Robotics Team had a competition rapidly approaching.
<therefore> My robot gained a version that could perform meaningless and unusal tasks such as kicking a football, lifting a dumbbell, and pushing small colored balls around an arena.

Felgen r2 Olympiad

I will insert photos here of Olympiad if I ever discover any or reconstruct it for nostalgia. We did not end up competing because it was discovered our college department had misrepresented the amount of funds we had for travel (by telling us it was a non-zero number.)

More time passed, I completed both of my Bachelor's degrees and eventually decided that I liked the version-based-model Felgen r2 had started to employ. Feature-creep was finally maximized when Nick asked me to assist with his Senior Project, an autonomous Lawnmowing robot.

Felgen r2 could not support, even remotely, a lawn-mowing apparatus. So parts were redesigned beginning with the chassis, moving to the steering mechanism, proceeding through the wheels (which became treads to improve grip,) and finally new parts were added entirely consisting of a modular, easily-printable "rack" system for adding components and modules.

Felgen r3, the infinitely modular and quite hideous Rocketsled.

It was here, at the end of Nick's project with a design that I ultimately didn't like, aesthetically or functionally, and certainly wasn't proud enough to display that I wanted to build, I decided Felgen's evolution had taken a serious misstep.

Felgen r4 -- On hiatus while it thinks about what it did. 

Sketches and ideas currently seem to lead to a different, more conservative, form of modularity with a much stronger emphasis on aesthetics. The singular positive f.Rocketsled had (differential steering) will be retained.

tLogoQube [[aka OligSat, MicroMagQube, MagPocketQube, EagleSat-1, Eagle-2, Beaker1, MicroMagSat, and "Money on the Barrelhead."]]

Large portions of this project's design and development I am disallowed from discussing. Public information I would like and am allowed to share on this project follows:

Approved text,
"Utilizing my previous work in the PCB design and coding of EagleSat-1, I coordinated a team in the integration of the Micromag 3-Axis Magnetometer and RFM22b Transmitter programmed in uLogo."

uLogo was/is Brian's (at Playful Invention Company) pet project and was in its initial development stages when we (attempted) to utilize it for our project at the behest of our Chief Science Officer located in Sonoma, CA (whom I shall not name.)
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160407031519/https://universe.sonoma.edu/T-LogoQube/sites/default/files/Presentations/TLQ_release_120213.pdf#overlay-context=">launch press-release documentation</a> says, "T-LogoQube was built by about  a dozen undergraduate students at SSU [...] and MSU's Department of Earth and Space Science[....]" and names exactly one of the more than 15 members of the Morehead State University Team which spanned 3 departments. The documentation says, "and Will Roche
led the MSU effort." Will's name is actually William Roach-Barrett. After my involvement began winding down, I handed off what resources regarding uLogo were available to him. Also deserving honorable mention is Kevon Jackson, at the time a Computer Science undergrad at MSU whose work was critical but whose name was unknown even to most team members. 

The real star of this project, in my opinion, was Jordan Halea. I can't count the number of all-nighters and almost-all-nighters he pulled in its completion. His hard work was truly humbling.

This more or less concludes the part I can discuss. Rather than discussing what I can't discuss and why, I'll ennumerate some of the shallow lessons I took away from this project.

The Best:
<ul><li>I have a picture of (then) President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussing my engineering prototype. This photo is likely to be the peak of my entire engineering career.
</ul>

<img>


The Good:
<ul>
  <li>Being the smartest person in a room is the worst way to work. Surrounding yourself with a team of people you can learn from is gift.
  <li>A team, or even a team member, who is passionate, dedicated, and hardworking can make impossible schedules less impossible and questionable design decisions seem reasonable (if not necessarily good.)
  <li>I am very fortunate to have worked on this project with more than a few engineers I believe to be unquestionably better than myself.
  <li>This project was my first experience with I2C and magnetometers. I am happy to report I am now confident enough to rely on them for future projects.
</ul>

The Bad:
<ul>
  <li><b>JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE WORKING FOR AN INTENSELY HIGH PROFILE PROJECT AND A REPUTABLE EMPLOYER YOU MUST NOT ASSUME THEY WILL TREAT YOU OR THE PROJECT FAIRLY OR EQUITABLY. IF YOU HAVE ANY INTEREST IN GETTING PAID FOR YOUR EFFORT, DEMAND CASH ON THE BARRELHEAD</b> (or at least a signed contractual agreement.)
  <li>Being the most reliable member in a vertical management structure should be reserved for the person at the top of said structure.
  <li>No amount of money is worth changing the design specifications on a project every 2 weeks for 52 consecutive weeks.
  <li>No amount of money is worth working with (and especially for) racists, homophobes, sexists or bigots.
  <li>'No money' is worth even less than 'no amount of money.'
  <li>Changing a project's name 8 times in 12 months makes promoting it through conventional press almost impossible.
  <li>There is absolutely zero reason why a management team of three people should change a project's name (publicly) 8 times.
  <li>Once a project is completed, deployed, and has ceased to function, there is no need to change its name.
</ul>

<h2>Charity<h2>

<p>Perhaps some image here? Not sure what would be appropriate. Maybe just something Left-aligned. Maybe a little Pride-bot. I like that idea. Some small bots raising a sign for The Trevor Project and Lambert House in their lifters.</p>

<p>From June 2017 to June 2018, EmptyRespon.se donated <b>83 percent</b> of its total revenue to charity. This year, donations went to <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/">The Trevor Project</a> and <a href="http://www.lamberthouse.org/">The Lambert House</a>.</p>
<p>Descriptions from their respective websites:
<br>
<blockquote>Founded in 1998 by the creators of the Academy AwardÂ®-winning short film TREVOR, The Trevor Project is the leading national organization providing crisis intervention and suicide prevention services to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer & questioning (LGBTQ) young people under 25.</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>Lambert House is a safe place for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth ages 11-22. Our calendar is packed with fun activities, support groups, planning meetings, dances, and other events. Lambert House is where LGBTQ youth make life better for each other.
<br><br>Come see what we are all about! Everyday, approximately 20-40 youth visit us. The drop-in center has large living rooms with a pool table, a music station for tunes, a library with LGBTQ books, TV, games, computer lab, and people to talk with about anything on your mind.
<br><br>You might be surprised how easy it can be to meet someone going through the same things you are! Some great ways to do that are joining a support group, an activity, talking to one of the adult volunteers, using our computer lab, getting dinner, shooting pool, or playing games.
<br><br>Lambert House serves a diverse group of youth. Over 50% of the youth who come to Lambert House are youth of color, and youth come to Lambert House activities from all over the region representing more than 130 zip codes equally distributed to the North, South, East and West.
</blockquote>
</p>
<br>
<p>At this point, of all the things our wonderful robots can do there are still two they can not. The first is cut hair. The second, and more important, is making youths, particularly LGBTQ+ youths, feel loved, accepted, and that they belong. Until such time that our robots can automate the tasks of love and acceptance to the degree that the members of the Trevor Project and the Lambert House can, EmptyRespon.se will proudly support them.</p>

Version Up!!, another EmptyRespon.se

<img>

<h2>A New Website; A New Vector For Introducing Error</h2>

<p>A year is a long time for a small technology business. In the twelve months from July 15, 2017 to July 15, 2018 EmptyRespon.se has changed homes, business practices (both financial and ethical) and now its web presence.</p>

<p>June of last year we announced we would be trying new things and we truly have. We tried expanding our staff to three engineers rather than one, we tried giving away all our profit, we tried to run a handshake-based business from an hour and a half away.</p>
<p>You can probably guess which one of those was <a href="charity">a success.</a></p>

<hr class="major" />
<h2><a href="failure">Our failures:</a></h2>

<p>EmptyRespon.se saw a regrettable reduction in clients as we moved our operation a little farther west. Our most loyal clients remain and EmptyRespon.se is still able to cover costs but our ability to give away money and start overly ambitious projects has decidedly dropped.</p>

<p>Taking this as a chance to capitalize on what we do well, EmptyRespon.se is now transitioning away from repair and support for individuals to focus on providing concierge support services for small businesses. We are absolutely still helping individuals but our waivers have changed and we will be seeing significantly fewer clients as we spend more and more time taking the headache out of small business technology.</p>

<p>Another lesson this transition taught us: engineers apparently enjoy being paid to solve problems. Asking potential employees to be altruistic was met with skepticism. Asking them to take an aescetic's pay scale proved too much. So, for now and a while longer, everyone's stuck with <a href="elawson">me</a>, <a href="felgen">my bots,</a> and our favorite intern <a href="nLemaster">Nick.</a></p>

<p>Don't be disheartened, though. While all our timetables have been pushed back per funding and personnel allocation, nothing is cancelled and <a href="HomeRun">something totally different is still on the way.</a></p>

<p>We hope you continue to enjoy EmptyRespon.se (revision 2.0) for the coming year as we make more changes, try new things, and hopefully build something we can all marvel at.</p>
